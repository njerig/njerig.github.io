I'm finally done with some cohesive thing that is this website. There are a few minor things that are bothering me about the design (in certain instances), but I'll work out the kinks over time.

Naturally, when making a blog takes you months (of sparse two-hour concentration sessions) to do, you have several unexplored post ideas.

This blog is supposed to serve as a project explanation dump, as well as a place to explore ideas I'm interested in. It's also a way to force me to write.

Anyway, if you find something on (or not on) this site you'd like to let me know about, shoot me an email/tweet/whatever and I'd be happy to consider. Links are in the footer.

Thanks for reading!
